preview: "I am an avid Magic the Gathering player. I mainly play Commander these days but I got started back in 2010 playing Standard. My prefered playstyle is Tempo, Building a resource gap between me and my opponents until I can push for victory. I often splash into Golgari colours to ensure recur my engines and threats while removing my opponents."

<p>I am an avid Magic the Gathering player. I mainly play Commander these days but I got started back in 2010 playing Standard. My prefered playstyle is Tempo, Building a resource gap between me and my opponents until I can push for victory. I often splash into Golgari colours to ensure recur my engines and threats while removing my opponents.</p>

<p><a href="https://moxfield.com/">Moxfield</a> is my prefered online deck builder, Though I have tried out <a href="https://archidekt.com/">Archidekt</a> and use <a href="https://manabox.app/">Manabox</a> for tracking my collection on my mobile. Moxfield's playtest feature feels more ergonomic and better thought out than Archidekt's; Playtesting is important given how much I goldfish my decks to make my cuts and substitutions. Primer's are attatch to decks to explain their brewing decisons, which are great for getting to know a commander.</p>
